    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <!--<a> is called an anchor element which is defined by wrapping text
        or another element that we want to be a link -->
    <!--href="" is what will create the text hyperlinked
        If we want to open this page in a new tab, we need
        to include the `target` attribute be default it is set to
        `_self` which opens in the same tab. A `rel` attribute is used to 
        describe the relation between the page and the linked document.
        The `noopener` value is used so the opened link prevents gaining access
        to the page from where it was opened from.
        The `noreferrer` value prevents knowing what source or page has a link to it,
        it also can be used on it's own as it holds `noopener` behaviour
